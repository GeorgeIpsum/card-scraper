At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of cash access transactions at ATMs, during each billing period, that are made using Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. If we agree to apply a limit, it is not a guarantee that the Additional Card Member will be able to make Purchases or cash access transactions up to the applicable limit. In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period.

Please allow 2-4 weeks after an eligible purchase is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s) to be posted to the Account. Please call the number on the back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 4 weeks from the date of purchase. American Express relies on the merchant to process transactions within the same calendar month that you made the purchase in order to apply the $10 monthly statement credit in the month that it was intended. For example, if you make an eligible purchase on the last day of the month and the merchant doesn't process that transaction until the next day, the transaction date will reflect the next day's date and the statement credit would be applied in the following month. Purchases posted after 120 days from the transaction date will not be considered for a Dining Benefit credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible for the benefit, you will not receive the statement credit. For example, your transaction will not be eligible if it is not made directly with the merchant. In addition, in most cases, you may not receive the statement credit if your transaction is made with an electronic wallet or through a third party or if the merchant uses a mobile or wireless card reader to process it. To be eligible for this benefit, Card Account(s) must not be canceled and not past due at the time of statement credit fulfillment. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account, the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance.

Eligible purchases through American Express Travel exclude car reservations and non-prepaid hotels. Points will be debited from your Membership Rewards account, and credit for corresponding dollar amount will be issued to the American Express Card account used. If points redeemed do not cover entire amount, the balance of purchase price will remain on the American Express Card account. Minimum redemption 5,000 points.See membershiprewards.com/terms for the Membership Rewards program terms and conditions.If a charge for a purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Linked Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you believe this has occurred, please contact us by calling the number on the back of your Card.<br><br><strong>Upgrade with Points Terms and Conditions</strong><br>When you use Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade, three things will happen: (i) If the airline upgrades your ticket(s), your Card Account will be charged for the upgrade; (ii) American Express will deduct the Membership Rewards points you offered for the upgrade from your program account; and (iii) American Express will apply an accompanying credit to your Card Account for those points. If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.Participating airlines' Terms &amp; Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance.

If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.Participating airlines' Terms &amp; Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you think this has happened, please call us using the number on the back of your Card.<br><br><strong>Fee Credit for Global Entry or TSA Pre✓®</strong><br>The benefit is available to (i) Corporate Gold Card Members, (ii) Consumer Platinum Card® Members, Corporate Platinum Card® Members and Business Platinum Card® Members, and (iii) Centurion® Card Members.

If you believe this has occurred, please contact us by calling the number on the back of your Card.<br><br><strong>Upgrade with Points Terms and Conditions</strong><br>When you use Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade, three things will happen: (i) If the airline upgrades your ticket(s), your Card Account will be charged for the upgrade; (ii) American Express will deduct the Membership Rewards points you offered for the upgrade from your program account; and (iii) American Express will apply an accompanying credit to your Card Account for those points. If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.Participating airlines' Terms &amp; Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you think this has happened, please call us using the number on the back of your Card.<br><br><strong>Extra Membership Rewards® points at amextravel.com</strong><br>2x PointsMembership Rewards-enrolled Card Members get at least 1 Membership Rewards® point for every eligible dollar spent on their Membership Rewards program-enrolled American Express® Card.

Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit.

Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer.

You may select up to 10 qualifying purchases for each plan that you create in your American Express online Account. You may select only one qualifying purchase for each plan that you create in the American Express App. Plan duration options may vary depending on the total dollar amount of the qualifying purchases you move into a Plan. Qualifying purchases will be identified in your American Express online Account and American Express App. Qualifying purchases do not include purchases of cash or cash equivalents, purchases subject to Foreign Transaction Fees or any fee owed to us, including Annual Membership fees.Your ability to create plans will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness or your credit limit. You will not be able to create plans if your Account is canceled. You will not be able to create plans if one or more of your American Express Accounts is enrolled into a debt management program, or has a payment that is returned unpaid, or is delinquent. The number and length of plan duration options offered to you, and the number of active plans you can have at a time, will be at our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness, the purchase amount, and your Account history. After a plan is paid in full, it will be removed from your Account in the next billing period.Plan It is available to Credit Card Accounts issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express, excluding Accounts with Pay Over Time and Credit Card Accounts that must be paid in full each month.

Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded Cards or Account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible.<br><br><strong>Spending Limits</strong><br>When you request that we apply a limit as described below on Charges incurred by an Additional Card Member on your Account, you agree to these terms. These terms supplement, and are incorporated by reference into, the terms of your Card Member Agreement.At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of Purchases, during each billing period, that are charged to Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of cash access transactions at ATMs, during each billing period, that are made using Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. If we agree to apply a limit, it is not a guarantee that the Additional Card Member will be able to make Purchases or cash access transactions up to the applicable limit. In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us.The Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions.<br><br><strong>Seller of Travel</strong><br>American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.,when acting solely as a sales agent for travel suppliers, is not responsible for the actions or inactions of such suppliers.

You earn: 1 additional point (for a total of 2 points) on the first $6,000 of eligible purchases in a calendar year at supermarkets located in the U.S. (superstores and warehouse clubs are not considered supermarkets). Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards; person-to-person payments or purchases of other cash equivalents. Additional terms and restrictions apply. Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. A purchase will not earn additional points if the merchant's code is not eligible. Purchases made through a third-party payment account or on an online marketplace (with multiple retailers) will not earn additional points. A purchase may not earn additional points if the merchant submits the purchase using a mobile or wireless card reader or if you use a mobile or digital wallet.<br><br><strong>Destination Family</strong><br>Valid for new bookings made through American Express Travel and eligible Travel Associate Platform agencies with participating travel providers: Abercrombie &amp; Kent, Royal Caribbean International, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, and Travel Impressions. Benefit varies by provider. Payment must be made with an American Express Card. Program benefits may not be available to residents outside of the contiguous United States. Card Member must travel on itinerary booked. Limit one benefit package per booking. May not be combined with other offers unless indicated. Blackout dates apply and benefits are subject to change. Benefits listed are non- transferable, subject to availability, and cannot be redeemed for cash or credit. Available to all U.S. American Express Corporate, Consumer, OPEN and Prepaid Cards.<br><br><strong>20% Extra Points Benefit</strong><br>How the Benefit Works If you make 20 or more separate purchases of goods or services in a billing period with your Amex EveryDay® Credit Card ("Card"), you earn 20% extra Membership Rewards points on those purchases less returns and credits with a date in that billing period. A transaction where you buy multiple items counts as one purchase. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. This benefit will not apply to any limited time promotions and offers (such as a Welcome Bonus).Impact of Returns and Credits Returns and credits do not reduce your purchase count. Returns and credits will reduce the number of Membership Rewards points and extra Membership Rewards points earned. Example: Suppose in a billing period you make 20 purchases totaling $500 and you return a $200 item that you purchased in the same or a prior billing period. The return does not reduce your purchase count, but it does reduce the Membership Rewards points on those purchases from 500 to 300. So, in this example you would earn 20% extra on those 300 points.When Purchases CountTo count purchases for this benefit, we use the date of the purchase. For example, if you make a purchase on the last day in your January billing period, it might not post to your account until your February billing period. If this happens, the purchase still counts towards your January billing period. In rare instances, a purchase may not post to your account for several billing periods. For example, extreme weather or other business disruptions may delay a merchant in submitting transactions to us. If a purchase posts to your account more than four billing periods after the purchase date, we count it for the billing period in which it posts, and not the purchase date. Some merchants combine separate charges into a single transaction before submitting it to us. When this happens, the combined transaction will count as a single purchase for purposes of counting towards 20 separate purchases. For example, if you charge three items to your Card at the same online merchant at three separate times over one or more days, the merchant may combine those three charges and submit them as a single transaction. In that case, that combined transaction will count as one purchase. Transaction Dates A date of a purchase, return or credit may sometimes be different from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. Also, if you use your Card while traveling (on a hotel, car rental, or while on a cruise), the purchase date may be the date you complete that travel. General Terms You will typically earn the 20% extra Membership Rewards points 8-12 weeks after the billing period in which you make the 20 or more eligible purchases.<br><br><strong>American Express Seating</strong><br>Please note that the tickets available through the American Express Seating program are available to all Card Members at no additional cost.

If you believe this has occurred, please contact us by calling the number on the back of your Card.<br><br><strong>Upgrade with Points Terms and Conditions</strong><br>When you use Upgrade with Points to request an airline ticket upgrade, three things will happen: (i) If the airline upgrades your ticket(s), your Card Account will be charged for the upgrade; (ii) American Express will deduct the Membership Rewards points you offered for the upgrade from your program account; and (iii) American Express will apply an accompanying credit to your Card Account for those points. If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.Participating airlines' Terms &amp; Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance.

The plan fee is a fixed finance charge that will be charged each month that the corresponding plan is active.To create a plan, select qualifying purchases of $100 or more and a plan duration. You may select up to 10 qualifying purchases for each plan that you create in your American Express online Account. You may select only one qualifying purchase for each plan that you create in the American Express App. Plan duration options may vary depending on the total dollar amount of the qualifying purchases you move into a Plan. Qualifying purchases will be identified in your American Express online Account and American Express App. Qualifying purchases do not include purchases of cash or cash equivalents, purchases subject to Foreign Transaction Fees or any fee owed to us, including Annual Membership fees.Your ability to create plans will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness or your credit limit. You will not be able to create plans if your Account is canceled. You will not be able to create plans if one or more of your American Express Accounts is enrolled into a debt management program, or has a payment that is returned unpaid, or is delinquent. The number and length of plan duration options offered to you, and the number of active plans you can have at a time, will be at our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness, the purchase amount, and your Account history. After a plan is paid in full, it will be removed from your Account in the next billing period.Plan It is available to Credit Card Accounts issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express, excluding Accounts with Pay Over Time and Credit Card Accounts that must be paid in full each month. Only the Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on the Account can create a plan. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded Cards or Account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible.<br><br><strong>Spending Limits</strong><br>When you request that we apply a limit as described below on Charges incurred by an Additional Card Member on your Account, you agree to these terms. These terms supplement, and are incorporated by reference into, the terms of your Card Member Agreement.At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of Purchases, during each billing period, that are charged to Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. At your request, we may agree to apply a limit to the total dollar amount of cash access transactions at ATMs, during each billing period, that are made using Card numbers associated with one or more specified Additional Card Members on your Account. If we agree to apply a limit, it is not a guarantee that the Additional Card Member will be able to make Purchases or cash access transactions up to the applicable limit. In applying any limit we will not take into account any credits (such as for returned merchandise or for payments), even if a credit relates to a Purchase made by the Additional Card Member. Any request that we change a limit may not be effective until a subsequent billing period. Any Charges (as defined below) incurred by the Additional Card Member prior to the date during a billing period that we apply the limit will not be subject to the limit for that billing period.Because of systems or administrative considerations, arrangements with merchants, or for other business reasons, we may, but are not required to, treat some Purchases and/or cash access transactions (collectively, Charges) as not being subject to any such limits. You agree to pay all Charges without regard to whether any Charges exceed a limit, and you agree that we are not liable to you or any other person when a limit is not applied to any Charges and/or when Charges are incurred and billed that exceed a limit. While we typically require merchants to obtain an authorization for purchases and submit final transaction documentation for payment in a timely manner, a limit may not apply or may be exceeded when a merchant does not obtain an authorization for any reason; when a merchant obtains an authorization for a partial amount of the final charge submitted to us for payment; or when such submissions are not submitted or processed at the same time that the authorization is obtained. Examples may include, but are not limited to: Charges made outside of the U.S., in duty-free stores, or on board airplanes or cruise vessels; international airline ticket Purchases; vehicle rentals; lodging stays extended beyond original reservation period; certain mail order Purchases; Purchases billed on a recurring basis; Purchases at gas stations; telecommunications charges, including charges incurred with calling cards; taxicab charges; security deposits; late, damage or other fees in connection with rentals; Purchases billed in installments; restaurant tips and other gratuities; and Charges that occur before the end of billing period, if the Charge is posted to your Account after the Closing Date of that billing period. Any limit will not be applied to Charges for foreign currency or for travelers cheques or gift cheques obtained other than by telephone from us.The Spending Limit for the Additional Card Member(s) is optional. If no Spending Limit is set on the Additional Card, spending capacity on this Card will be subject to the Basic Card Member's account terms and conditions.<br><br><strong>Seller of Travel</strong><br>American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.,when acting solely as a sales agent for travel suppliers, is not responsible for the actions or inactions of such suppliers.

Benefit varies by provider. Payment must be made with an American Express Card. Program benefits may not be available to residents outside of the contiguous United States. Card Member must travel on itinerary booked. Limit one benefit package per booking. May not be combined with other offers unless indicated. Blackout dates apply and benefits are subject to change. Benefits listed are non- transferable, subject to availability, and cannot be redeemed for cash or credit. Available to all U.S. American Express Corporate, Consumer, OPEN and Prepaid Cards.<br><br><strong>50% Extra Points Benefit</strong><br>How the Benefit Works If you make 30 or more separate purchases of goods or services in a billing period with your Amex EveryDay® Preferred Credit Card ("Card"), you earn 50% extra Membership Rewards points on those purchases less returns and credits with a date in that billing period. A transaction where you buy multiple items counts as one purchase. Purchases do not include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards; person-to-person payments or purchases of other cash equivalents. This benefit will not apply to any limited time promotions and offers (such as a Welcome Bonus).Impact of Returns and Credits Returns and credits do not reduce your purchase count. Returns and credits will reduce the number of Membership Rewards points and extra Membership Rewards points earned. Example: Suppose in a billing period you make 30 purchases totaling $500 and you return a $200 item that you purchased in the same or a prior billing period. The return does not reduce your purchase count, but it does reduce the Membership Rewards points on those purchases from 500 to 300. So, in this example you would earn 50% extra on those 300 points. When Purchases CountTo count purchases for this benefit, we use the date of the purchase. For example, if you make a purchase on the last day in your January billing period, it might not post to your account until your February billing period. If this happens, the purchase still counts towards your January billing period. In rare instances, a purchase may not post to your account for several billing periods. For example, extreme weather or other business disruptions may delay a merchant in submitting transactions to us. If a purchase posts to your account more than four billing periods after the purchase date, we count it for the billing period in which it posts, and not the purchase date. Some merchants combine separate charges into a single transaction before submitting it to us. When this happens, the combined transaction will count as a single purchase for purposes of counting towards 30 separate purchases. For example, if you charge three items to your Card at the same online merchant at three separate times over one or more days, the merchant may combine those three charges and submit them as a single transaction. In that case, that combined transaction will count as one purchase. Transaction Dates A date of a purchase, return or credit may sometimes be different from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. Also, if you use your Card while traveling (on a hotel, car rental, or while on a cruise), the purchase date may be the date you complete that travel. General Terms You will typically earn the 50% extra Membership Rewards points 8-12 weeks after the billing period in which you make the 30 or more eligible purchases.<br><br><strong>American Express Seating</strong><br>Please note that the tickets available through the American Express Seating program are available to all Card Members at no additional cost.

If the airline upgrades your ticket(s) and the number of points available in your Membership Rewards program account is less than the number of points you originally offered, American Express will deduct only the number of points available and you will receive an accompanying credit only for that number of points. The credit to your Card Account may appear during a different billing cycle than the charge for upgrade. You are still responsible for paying the amount due on your Card statement by the due date. Any applicable taxes and fees in connection with an airline ticket upgrade will be charged to your Card Account and cannot be covered with points. The value of the points you offer is determined at the time your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline and may change after your upgrade offer has been submitted if you subsequently upgrade or downgrade your Card Account. Once accepted by the airline, your upgrade offer is nonrefundable, non-changeable, and points cannot be returned to your Membership Rewards program account.Each airline determines whether to accept upgrade offers and which upgrade offers it will accept based on factors it determines in its discretion, including the amount of an offer. While it is possible for airlines to accept an upgrade offer at any time after offer submission, most upgrades are processed between 5 and 1 days before departure, and some are processed as close as 1 hour before departure. If your flight reservation includes tickets for more than one passenger, the tickets for all passengers on the reservation will be upgraded if your upgrade offer is accepted by the airline. If you would like to upgrade only certain passengers, you must contact the airline to split your reservation prior to requesting an upgrade.If your Card offers additional points for flights purchased directly from an airline, you will not receive additional points for your upgrade purchase.Participating airlines' Terms &amp; Conditions apply. Participating airlines are subject to change at any time without notice. Participating airline products and services are subject to change. American Express reserves the right to cancel any upgrade offers or discontinue the Upgrade with Points program at any time.If you use a Pay Over Time feature for a purchase using Upgrade with Points, the statement credit you receive may not be applied to that feature. Instead, it might be applied to your Pay in Full balance.
